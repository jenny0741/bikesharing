## Purpose
Utilizing Tableau and CSV data files, analysis was conducted to understand how the bike-sharing business in New York City functions. This dataset included target population demographic, popular start/end locations, and duration for bike-sharing. From this analysis, a proposal will be written and presented to a potential investor on how a bike-sharing business will potentially function in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results
Below are the visualizations of the results from the analysis along with descriptions.

## Summary
Based on the results from the analysis, it can be seen that the main clientele for the bike-sharing business in New York City comes from local residents (mostly office workers) in the area, who utilize the service for commutes to and from work. Assuming that the target population for the bike-sharing business in Des Moines will be office workers, it would be a good idea to set-up stations within a 10-minute radius of each other and office buildings. By doing so, it will ensure that bike-sharing stations are accessible since Des Moines isn't as dense or highly populated. 

To further analysis and provide more insight on the bike-sharing business, it would be nice to have visualizations on trends for bike-sharing during winter months in New York City. This will help in determining if a bike-sharing business will be profitable during winter months when there will most likely be less business. Another visualization that could be beneficial is one based on trends during holiday seasons. Although the base clientele is office workers, being able to compare normal business operations vs. holiday operations will provide to be useful to determine if tourism will increase business sales and productivity.
